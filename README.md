This is a neighborhood map of the French Quarter that integrates Google Maps API as well as Foursquare's API.
Users can click on the highlighted locations of restaurants, bars, cafe's and grocers.  The infowindow will
load with the Foursquare name and address of the highlighted location along with the registered Foursquare phone number
of the business.  Users can also type a search into the "Search Highlights" box on the top left or zoom in/out.

Enjoy!
